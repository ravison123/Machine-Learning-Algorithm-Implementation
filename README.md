# Machine-Learning-Algorithm-Implementation
This repository is for implementation of machine learning algorithms from scratch (using Python Numpy)
1. Linear Regression (Notebook name: Linear Regeression.ipynb)
This jupyter notebook file implements linear regression algorithm using Python Numpy library. The notebook contains implementation of linear regression using "Batch Gradient Descent Optimization" algorithm and also using "Normal Equation".
